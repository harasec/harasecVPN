                    HarasecVPN

  - Multi-hop VPN hosted by my own ISP.
  - You will appear in multiple locations, with each site you visit showing a different IP.
  - Each app you use will also be assigned a different IP.
  - No data will be stored for more than 120 seconds. Which means your data will not exist.
  - Traffic routed like Tor with enhanced encryption.
  - Totally free version available.
  - Yearly subscription version includes an additional email feature.
  - My goal is to make an actual useful VPN service which actually provides privacy.
  - I have plans to release the first version of HarasecVPN on August 21st 2025 - September 21st 2025.
